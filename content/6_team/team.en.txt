Memoriam-text-left: It was with great sadness and shock that we announced the passing of Tanja Báez in October 2016. As a co-founder of the Contemporary Dance School Hamburg, Tanja was one of the school's pillars from the very beginning, and her loss will be irreplaceable. She embarked on her final journey with strength, courage, and without complaint, and will forever be a role model for us.
