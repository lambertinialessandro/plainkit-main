    "On the trail" describes the situation
    after a disruption, the moment when
    things begin to fall back into place
    after being shaken or even shattered. In
    this moment of apparent chaos, where
    normality no longer functions or only
    functions to a limited extent, lies the
    potential to sense the essence of things
    and redefine normality.
  project_description_right: >
    Structures develop, habits become
    ingrained. What is perceived as normal
    is the result of a constant, sometimes
    unreflective, reproduction of what is
    considered right, desirable, and
    productive. We function and forget to
    question.

  project_description_left: "on the trail beschreibt die Situation nach einem Einschnitt, den Moment, wenn sich Dinge wieder zusammenfügen, nachdem sie erschüttert wurden oder sogar zerbrochen sind. In diesem Moment des scheinbaren Chaos', in welchem die Normalität nicht mehr oder nur bedingt funktioniert, liegt ein Potenzial, die Essenz der Dinge zu erahnen und Normalität neu zu definieren."
  project_description_right: >
    Strukturen entwickeln sich, Gewohnheiten
    manifestieren sich. Was als normal
    wahrgenommen wird, ist Resultat einer
    steten mitunter unreflektierten
    Reproduktion dessen, was als richtig,
    erstrebenswert und produktiv gilt. Wir
    funktionieren und vergessen in Frage zu
    stellen.

    Utopia is a place of longing, projection of our dreams and desires, a promise and the reason why we continue, transcend and move forward.
    
    „Utopia lies at the horizon.
    When I draw nearer by two steps,
    it retreats two steps.
    If I proceed ten steps forward,
    It swiftly slips ten steps ahead.
    No matter how far I go, I can never reach it.
    What, then, is the purpose of utopia?
    It is to cause us to advance.“ (Eduardo Galeano)

    14 human beings share in short pieces their paths of what’s underneath their own utopias: the steps, the obstacles, the fears, the achievements, their trips and all that lies under the impulse to keep moving forward.
    
    What’s under your utopia?

  project_subjects: Solo project
  project_description_left: |
    The central examination requirement in the second year of training at CDSH consists of creating an original short production. This year, 19 dancers developed short pieces, which, under the theme "What does Looking Taste Like?", explore a wide range of topics.
    
    The Ho’Omau class invites you to embark on a delicious journey through three different dinners, each with a carefully assembled six-course meal. A variety of flavors is guaranteed to delight even the most refined and delicate appetite. You will taste coldness and darkness, splashed with a dash of tenderness, as well as warmth and joy, accompanied by vibrant colors and aromas. It will surprise and satisfy your desires.

    Whatever your eyes crave, we are.
    
    In composition workshops led by Jascha Viehstädt and Raymond Liew Jin Pin, the trainees acquired the methods and tools to create their own pieces. Our artistic director, Raul Valdez, provided mentoring sessions, as he does every year, helping them find the right format and offering impetus for the implementation of their concepts and ideas. Björn Salzer supported the choreographers in developing and realizing their lighting concepts, while dramaturgical consultation was provided by Matthias Quabbe as part of a dramaturgy seminar. Javier Báez, Sina Rundel, and Josefine Taape handled the areas of consulting, logistics, and production.

  project_title: Meeting Point

  project_description_left: |
    Each year, the final project, the culminating examination performance of our graduates, takes place under a different theme. Raul Valdez, artistic director of CDSH – Contemporary Dance School Hamburg, draws inspiration for the theme from the energy and dynamism of each graduating class. This year, "meeting point" is both the guiding theme and a space for experimentation for all choreographers and dancers.
    
    A "meeting point" is primarily a specific place in time and space. When people come together, they do so not only from different geographical directions, but also with diverse social backgrounds, education, cultures, and religious and political convictions. A meeting point is therefore not just a place of arrival, but also a place of departure: here, people share their different perspectives and ideals and leave with new outlooks.
    
    In antiquity, it was a place in the centers of city-states where people with diverse, often opposing, opinions and perspectives could come together to discuss and shape political reality. A meeting place that marks the birthplace of modern democracy.
  project_description_right: |
    The openness to see and hear one another requires an awareness of the complexity of reality, of contradictions, gray areas, and overlaps. True solutions do not lie in crude oversimplifications, rigid ideologies, and the demonization of opposing views, but in the nuances that lie between stereotypes and extremes.
    
    In times when fronts are hardening, populist rhetoric is mobilizing people and creating political realities, coming together is of particular importance. The world is not made up of a series of absolutes, but of a web of different truths. The only way to reconcile them is to listen to one another and meet one another with empathy.
    
    Last but not least, we also find such meeting places within ourselves, when different aspects of the self enter into dialogue: our own past and present, different emotional states, or conflicting desires and values.

    The central examination requirement in the second year of training at CDSH consists of the creation of an original short production. This year, 22 dancers developed short pieces, which, under the theme of "APPERCEPTION," explore a wide range of topics.
    
    Spilled ink on the paper. A picture is forming. Is it a butterfly? Two people holding hands?
    
    How can I tell the difference between an objective truth and my subjective interpretation of it? Is there even such a thing as objective when we all look at the world through our own biases?

    "The question is not what you look at, but what you see." – This is Apperception.
    
    In composition workshops with Jascha Viehstädt and Raymond Liew Jin Pin, as well as with Claudia Ferrando and Lisa Hofmann, the trainees were given the methods and tools to realize their own pieces. Our artistic director, Raul Valdez, provided mentoring sessions, as he does every year, helping them find the right format and offering impetus for the implementation of their concepts and ideas. Björn Salzer supported the choreographers in developing and realizing their lighting concepts, Claudia Ferrando in music editing and sound design, and dramaturgical consultation was provided through a dramaturgy seminar led by Matthias Quabbe. Consulting, logistics, and production were handled by Javier Báez, Sina Rundel, and Josefine Taape.
