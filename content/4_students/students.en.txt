  class_id: yuugen
  class_name: Yugen
  class_description_left: >
    “Yūgen” is an aesthetic concept in
    traditional Japanese art that describes
    the deep, mystical beauty of the
    unfathomable and the unseen. The term is
    often used in poetry, Nō theater (a
    traditional form of Japanese theater),
    and painting,
  class_description_right: >
    emphasizing the feeling of connection to
    something greater that is only hinted at
    but never fully grasped. In art, Yūgen
    is seen as the moment when an inner
    truth is revealed through suggestion or
    silence.

  class_description_left: >
    “Ikigai” is a Japanese concept that
    means your reason for being or your
    purpose in life. It is unique to every
    person, it allows you to express
    yourself freely and truthfully,
    according to your own rules or values.
  class_description_right: >
    As a group we are connected through the
    search for our own ikigai, exploring our
    unique traits, our role in the world
    (community) and discovering what we want
    to say as artists.

  class_description_left: >
    Ho’omau signifies resilience and
    perseverance. As a class, we value and
    trust the process of growth, in the many
    different forms it may come in. By
    understanding that our journeys as
    artists won’t always be linear or
    necessarily
  class_description_right: >
    smooth sailing, we are able to steady
    each other and carry on together. We are
    a group who keeps moving forward, no
    matter the obstacles, and in doing so,
    learns how to take care of each other as
    dancers and most importantly, as people.
